/**
 * ICU4JFeature enables ICU4J library ({@link "http://site.icu-project.org/"} to be used in SVM.
 * <p>
 * The main obstacle in using the ICU4J library as is was that the library relies on class loader to
 * fetch localization data from resource files included in the ICU4J jar archive. This feature is
 * not supported by SVM, so the next option was to read the resource files from the file system. The
 * following code addresses several issues that occurred when specifying
 * <code>com.ibm.icu.impl.ICUBinary.dataPath</code> system property in runtime (standard ICU4J
 * feature).
