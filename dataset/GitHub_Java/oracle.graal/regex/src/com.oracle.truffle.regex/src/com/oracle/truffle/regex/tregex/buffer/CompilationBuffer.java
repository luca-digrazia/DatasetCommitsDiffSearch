/**
 * This class is instantiated once per compilation of a regular expression in
 * {@link TRegexCompiler#compile(RegexSource)} and is supposed to reduce the amount of allocations
 * during automaton generation. It provides various "scratch-pad" buffers for the creation of arrays
 * of unknown size. When using these buffers, take extra care not to use them in two places
 * simultaneously! {@link TRegexCompiler#compile(RegexSource)} is designed to be run
 * single-threaded, but nested functions may still lead to "simultaneous" use of these buffers.
