     * A library that was created using a receiver value i.e. a cached library only guarantees to
     * accept the value it was constructed with. The method may return <code>false</code> for other
     * receiver types. Such libraries need to verify acceptance before calling a library method with
     * a receiver. If receiver values are not accepted then a new library library needs to be
     * created or fetched. Dispatched versions of libraries always return <code>true</code> for any
     * value as they take care of dispatching to any receiver type.
     * <p>
     * Code for calling the accepts method can e generated using the {@link CachedLibrary} of
     * Truffle DSL. It recommended to not directly call accepts but let the DSL take care of this
     * step.
     * <p>
     * The accepts message may be be exported by a library. When exported by a library it can only
     * be further restricted. The minimum restriction the exact receiver type of the exported
     * receiver type. An implementation of accepts may just return <code>true</code> to provide such
     * behavior.
