/**
 * Libraries are specified with <code>public</code> and <code>abstract</code> Java classes that
 * extend {@linkplain Library} and are annotated by <code>@GenerateLibrary</code>. A library
 * consists of a set of messages, that are specified using public Java methods. The methods may be
 * abstract or use a default implementations. The first parameter of every method is the receiver
 * parameter, which is mandatory and must be a sub type of {@link Object} and the same across all
 * messages of a library. There are no restrictions on the return type or argument types of a
 * message. Every method that specifies a message must have a name that is unique for a library.
 * Final or private methods are ignored. Parameter type overloading is currently not support for
 * messages. Generic type arguments local to messages are generally supported, but generic type
 * arguments on the library type are not yet supported.
 * <p>
 *
 * <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
 *
 * The following example specifies a basic library for arrays:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;GenerateLibrary
 * public abstract class ArrayLibrary extends Library {
 *
 *     public boolean isArray(Object receiver) {
 *         return false;
 *     }
 *
 *     public abstract int read(Object receiver, int index);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Messages that are not implemented and have no default implementation throw an
 * {@link AbstractMethodError}. The {@link Abstract} annotation can be used, to provide a default
 * implementation for receiver types but at the same time make the message abstract.
 *
 * @see DefaultExport to specify default exports.
 * @see Abstract to make messages abstract if they have a default implemetnation
 * @since 1.0
