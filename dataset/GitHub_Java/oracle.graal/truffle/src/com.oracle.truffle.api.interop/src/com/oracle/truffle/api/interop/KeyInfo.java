/**
 * This class represents {@link Message#KEY_INFO key info} bit flags. Use this class as a utility to
 * get or set the bit flags when dealing with {@link Message#KEY_INFO} message.
 * <p>
 * The bit flags have following meaning:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #READABLE}: if {@link Message#READ reading} an existing key is supported.
 * <li>{@link #MODIFIABLE}: if {@link Message#WRITE writing} an existing key is supported.
 * <li>{@link #INSERTABLE} if {@link Message#WRITE writing} a new key is supported.
 * <li>{@link #INVOCABLE}: if {@link Message#INVOKE invoking} an existing key is supported.
 * <li>{@link #REMOVABLE} if {@link Message#REMOVE removing} an existing key is supported.
 * <li>{@link #INTERNAL} if an existing key is internal.
 * <li>{@link #READ_SIDE_EFFECTS} if {@link Message#READ} of the key value may have side-effects,
 * i.e. may change values of some keys, state of objects, etc.
 * <li>{@link #WRITE_SIDE_EFFECTS} if {@link Message#WRITE} of the key value may have side-effects,
 * i.e. may change values of other keys, state of other objects, etc.
 * <p>
 * When a {@link #isReadable(int) readable} or {@link #isWritable(int) writable} flag is
 * <code>true</code>, it does not necessarily guarantee that subsequent {@link Message#READ} or
 * {@link Message#WRITE} message will succeed. Read or write can fail due to some momentary bad
 * state. An object field is expected not to be readable resp. writable when it's known that the
 * field can not be read (e.g. a bean property without a getter) resp. can not be written to (e.g. a
 * bean property without a setter). The same applies to invocable flag and {@link Message#INVOKE}
 * message.
 * <p>
 *
 * @since 0.26
 * @deprecated see the individual constants and methods for replacements.
