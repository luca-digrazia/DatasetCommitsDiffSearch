/**
 * A runtime environment for one or more {@link PolyglotEngine} instances. By default multiple
 * {@linkplain PolyglotEngine engines} operate independently - e.g. they have their own isolated
 * {@linkplain PolyglotRuntime runtime}. However, sometimes it may be useful (for example to save
 * valuable resources needed for code and various other metadata) to group a set of
 * {@linkplain PolyglotEngine engines} into a single {@linkplain PolyglotRuntime runtime}. One can
 * do it like this:
 * <p>
 * {@codesnippet com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.test.AbstractInstrumentationTest}
 * <p>
 * The above example prepares a single instance of the {@link PolyglotRuntime runtime} and
 * {@link PolyglotEngine.Builder#runtime(com.oracle.truffle.api.vm.PolyglotRuntime) uses it} when
 * configuring {@linkplain PolyglotEngine.Builder engine builder} in the <code>createEngine</code>
 * method. The method may be called multiple times yielding engines sharing essential execution
 * resources behind the scene.
