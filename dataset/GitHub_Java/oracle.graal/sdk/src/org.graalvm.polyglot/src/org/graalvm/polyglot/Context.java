/**
 * A polyglot execution context for Graal {@linkplain Language guest languages} that supports
 * <em>interoperability</em> between languages and with Java.
 *
 * <h4>Sample Usage</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Context Creation and Disposal</h4>
 *
 * Create a context with default configuration by invoking the static method
 * {@link #create(String...) create()}, which optionally restricts the languages that may be used in
 * the context. Create a context with custom configuration with a {@linkplain #newBuilder(String...)
 * builder}. In addition to restricting languages, the builder can configure input, error and output
 * streams, both engine and context options, and application arguments.
 * <p>
 * Multiple contexts created with a single {@link Builder#engine(Engine) execution engine}, also
 * share configurations and {@link Instrument instruments}. See {@link Engine} for more details.
 * <p>
 * A context that is no longer needed should be {@link #close() closed} to guarantee that all
 * allocated resources are freed. If no code is currently executing in a context then it may be
 * closed from any thread. If code is currently executing in a context, a different thread can close
 * it using the boolean <code>cancelIfRunning</code> parameter of the {@link #close(boolean) close}
 * method. Contexts are {@link AutoCloseable} so they may be used with the Java
 * {@code try-with-resources} statement.
 *
 * <h4>Language Initialization</h4>
 *
 * Each language performs some initialization in a context before it can be
 * {@linkplain Source#getLanguage() used}, after which it remains initialized for the lifetime of
 * the context. Initialization is by default lazy and automatic, but it can be
 * {@link Context#initialize(String) forced}.
 * <p>
 *
 * <h4>Evaluation</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Polyglot Values</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Symbol Lookup</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Interoperability</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
 *
 * Most methods of a context throw {@link PolyglotException} if errors occur in guest languages.
 *
 * <h4>Proxys</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Thread-Safety</h4>
 *
 * A context only permits guest language code execution by one thread at a time, but it need not
 * always be the same thread. An attempt to execute code in a context where an execution is
 * currently underway will result in an {@link IllegalStateException}. On the other hand it is
 * always thread-safe to access meta-data from the context's {@link #getEngine() engine}.
 *
 * @since 1.0
