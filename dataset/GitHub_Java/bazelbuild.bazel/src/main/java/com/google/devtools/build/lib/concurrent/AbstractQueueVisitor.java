/**
 * AbstractQueueVisitor is a wrapper around {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} which
 * delays thread pool shutdown until entire visitation is complete.
 * This is useful for cases in which worker tasks may submit additional tasks.
 *
 * <p>Consider the following example:
 * <pre>
 *   ThreadPoolExecutor executor = <...>
 *   executor.submit(myRunnableTask);
 *   executor.shutdown();
 *   executor.awaitTermination();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This won't work properly if {@code myRunnableTask} submits additional
 * tasks to the executor, because it may already have shut down
 * by that point.
 *
 * <p>AbstractQueueVisitor supports interruption. If the main thread is
 * interrupted, tasks will no longer be added to the queue, and the
 * {@link #work(boolean)} method will throw {@link InterruptedException}.
