     * Bayesian information criterion (BIC). BIC or Schwarz Criterion is a criterion for
     * model selection among a class of parametric models with different numbers
     * of parameters. Choosing a model to optimize BIC is a form of regularization.
     * <p>
     * When estimating model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation, it
     * is possible to increase the likelihood by adding additional parameters,
     * which may result in over-fitting. The BIC resolves this problem by
     * introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model.
     * BIC is very closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
     * However, its penalty for additional parameters is stronger than that of AIC.
     * <p>
     * The formula for the BIC is BIC = L - 0.5 * v * log n where L is the
     * log-likelihood of estimated model, v is the number of free parameters
     * to be estimated in the model, and n is the number of samples.
     * <p>

     * the one to be preferred.
