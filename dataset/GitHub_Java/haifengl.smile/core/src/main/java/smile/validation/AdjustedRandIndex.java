/**
 * Adjusted Rand Index. Rand index is defined as the number of pairs of objects
 * that are either in the same group or in different groups in both partitions
 * divided by the total number of pairs of objects. The Rand index lies between
 * 0 and 1. When two partitions agree perfectly, the Rand index achieves the
 * maximum value 1. A problem with Rand index is that the expected value of
 * the Rand index between two random partitions is not a constant. This problem
 * is corrected by the adjusted Rand index that assumes the generalized
 * hyper-geometric distribution as the model of randomness. The adjusted Rand
 * index has the maximum value 1, and its expected value is 0 in the case
 * of random clusters. A larger adjusted Rand index means a higher agreement
 * between two partitions. The adjusted Rand index is recommended for measuring
 * agreement even when the partitions compared have different numbers of clusters.
