/**
 * The interaction of all the factors appearing in the term.
 * The interaction of one factor with another is that each
 * of its levels is tested in each level of the other factor.
 * For example, in a test of influences on crop yield, a watering
 * regime factor (W: wet and dry) is crossed with a sowing density
 * factor (D: high and low) when the response to the wet regime
 * is tested at both high and low sowing density, and so is the
 * response to the dry regime. If each of the four combinations
 * of levels has replicate observations, then a cross-factored
 * analysis can test for an interaction between the two treatment
 * factors in their effect on the response.
